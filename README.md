# Machine-Learning-Traditional-Python
This is a brief introduction and can be used for people of all levels. It is preffered to use the amazing Google Collaboratory because that is what this was made for. But you may use the python file if you want to do it that way. The function %%time will not usually work outside of Jupyter Notebook which is what Google Collaboratory was built on.
You must install sci-kit learn and all the other libraries that is necessary if you are not using Google Collaboratory. Even though neural networks can usually get a better training and testing score it is very important to know your traditional machine learning because of the nueral network complexitiy.
